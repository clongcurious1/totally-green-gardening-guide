# totally-green-gardening-guide
My first Front-End Web Dev project as part of Code Louisville (2021)

**Summary:**
*The Totally Green Gardening Guide* is a 5-page site built with a beginner’s understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- Page 1, Home – Features call-to-action button, “Let's Dig In”, which drives to Conditions page. 
- Page 2, Conditions – Asks site visitors to identify the hours of daylight and amount of moisture for their planting site. Offers four garden site descriptions: Sunny + Dry, Sunny + Moist, Shady + Dry, Shady + Moist. User chooses a condition by clicking on a link, and lands on a specific section of the (recommended) No-Fail Plants page.
- Page 3, No-Fail Plants – For each of the (4) planting site Conditions listed above, users are provided with a recommended gardening style and the option to click to view (4) hidden tables with lists of No Fail plants to match light/water resources. 
- Page 4, Pests – Introduces users to (6) common garden Pests, Pollinators and Predators. 
- Page 5, Contact – HTML form collects information for e-newsletter sign-up. Users can also post a comment or question in a text box. 

**Mandatory Elements for Inspection:**
- Minimum of TWO Media Queries, each must MOVE (realign) content on the page, designed with “mobile first” principles in mind. See basic-styles.css file for Media Queries in use on the Pests and Contact pages. See nav.css file for Media Queries that support responsive header/navigation. 
- Minimum of FIVE separate Git-to-GitHub commits. There were 52 commits as of 7.28.2021.
- README File – Must be in the top level of project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when anyone views your project. 

**MINIMUM of (3) custom elements required for Inspection:**
*[1 CSS, 1 JavaScript, +1 additional feature from either CSS or JavaScript list]*
- CSS – Navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, switching between vertical and horizontal styles.
-JavaScript – Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction. Please see (4) hidden tables on the No-Fail Plants page.
- CSS – Use nth-child or nth-of-type to style a series of elements on your page. Example: change the background color for every other row in a table. See (4) tables on No-Fail Plants page with zebra stripe rows.

**ADDITIONAL Features for Inspection and Consideration toward Project Requirements:**
- CSS – Use CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. MUST  REARRANGE CONTENT (example: single column mobile layout changes to multi-column layout on desktop). Please see PESTS page, note grid with Pests, Pollinators and Predators. Layout changes: Mobile (1 column), Tablet (2 columns), Desktop (3 columns).
- JavaScript – Create a form (example: Contact Us), use onsubmit to allow HTML5 validation of most form fields to occur prior to Submit, then use JavaScript to capture value from at least one form field and use that value to display a message or alert back to the user.

**Notes:**	
- Per Mentors, we can use any open-source coding examples as inspiration in our projects. However, those “lifted’ features cannot be submitted “as is” – we must customize some facet of the open-source code to include it as a “requirement” in our project.  
- In addition to building a project that meets specific coding requirements, successfully completing the Code Louisville Front-End Development course also requires completing all Treehouse videos, attending (and submitting) two approved tech networking events, and participating in a KentuckianaWorks Workforce Readiness training session.
