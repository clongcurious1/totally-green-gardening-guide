# totally-green-gardening-guide
My first Front-End Web Dev project as part of Code Louisville (2021)

**Summary:**
*The Totally Green Gardening Guide* is a 6-page site built with a beginner’s understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- Page 1, Home – Features background video and central call-to-action button, “Dig In”, which drives to Conditions page. 
- Page 2, Conditions – Site visitors identify the hours of daylight and amount of moisture for their planting site. There are four options: Sunny + Dry, Sunny + Moist, Shady + Dry, Shady + Moist. Choosing a condition by clicking on a button takes the user to a specific section of the (garden) Styles page.
- Page 3, Styles – For each of the (4) planting site Conditions listed above, users are provided with a recommended gardening style and the option to click to view tables with lists of (5) No Fail plants for those conditions. 
- Page 4, To Do List – Aspiring gardeners can add and remove items from a Gardening To Do list. 
- Page 5, Pest Control – Site visitors can play a simple game to identify pests vs. pollinators. 
- Page 6, Contact – Offers form to sign-up for “Grow With Us” e-newsletter, select multiple gardening interests, or leave a free-form comment in a text box. 

**Mandatory Elements for Inspection:**
- Minimum of TWO Media Queries, each must MOVE (realign) content on the page, designed with “mobile first” principles in mind 
- Minimum of FIVE separate Git-to-GitHub commits
- README File – Must be in the top level of your project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when viewing your project. 

**MINIMUM of (3) custom elements required for Inspection:**
*[1 CSS, 1 JavaScript, +1 additional feature from either list]*
- CSS – Navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, switching between vertical and horizontal styles and/or is opened and closed by clicking on the “hamburger” icon.
- Javascript – (Your Perfect day) In an HTML form, use Javascript to VALIDATE email and show a message back to user: EMAIL NOT VALID, EMAIL VALID…OR change a setting on the page based on that action. GOAL: On “Submit”, show “Thanks for daydreaming with us! Your input helps us inspire others and create more Perfect Days!”
- CSS – Use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. MUST  REARRANGE CONTENT (example: single column mobile layout changes to multi-column layout on desktop)

**ADDITIONAL Features for Inspection and Consideration toward Project Requirements:**
- CSS – Use nth-child or nth-of-type to style a series of elements on your page. Example: change the background color for every other row in a table
- CSS – create your own CSS animation. Example: loading spinner
-JavaScript – Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction.
- JavaScript – Create a form (example: Contact Us), use client-side validation upon SUBMIT (example: check to see if email address is in correct format), and then use that information to display a message or alert back to the user or change a page setting.
- JavaScript – create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates score, etc.), and displays the result on your page or uses the value to do something on the site. 

**Notes:**	
- Per Mentors, we can use any open-source coding examples as inspiration in our projects. However, those “lifted’ features cannot be submitted “as is” – we must customize some facet of the open-source code to include it as a “requirement” in our project.  
- In addition to building a project that meets specific coding requirements, successfully completing the Code Louisville Front-End Development course also requires completing all Treehouse videos, attending (and submitting) two approved tech networking events, and participating in a KentuckianaWorks Workforce Readiness training session.
